I've just recently hit the one year mark of being a professional software developer.   

<br />

A year in any industry is not a lot, but in software it feels kinda funny. You start off knowing nothing and being *very* aware of it. Then you hit 5-6 months and think - "this whole software thing is easy".

<br />

And that is such a hilarious thought to have because it is anything but easy.

<br />
 
One of the things you have to battle when being a new dev is your attitude. This seems like an easy thing but I've worked for many years before this and consider myself to be quite good in this regard. 
  
<br />
 
It's so easy in software to judge yourself by your intentions and others by their actions. You start to see the ~ 10 year old codebase and you can't help but to critisie it. 

<br />

You find yourself questioning everything without giving respect to the people and the position they were in when the decision was made. I've come to realise this happens to a lot of people for a few reasons. 

<br />

The obvious one is that you're only experience is with very small/trivial projects where it was pretty easy to keep the code clean and you understand most of it because... You wrote it. Typically you are also learning a lot about best practices and you have thoughts like "wow this code is terrible, this would never be allowed out in the industry". Then you enter the industry and see code that is just honestly horrific.

<br />

You only begin to be become sympathetic to this after finding yourself in the same positions writing equally bad code. Deadlines approaching, pressure to deliver building and this is when you have a wonderful and horrible lightbulb moment that you have been a bit of an ass. Sometimes you just need to get the thing working and ship it.

<br />

There is one other reason that I don't see mentioned very often but I think is very real. Being a little defensive. This is natural with software because it's so complex and mixed with above reason of finding complex, hard to read code you are immediately confronted with the thought - "I have no idea what I'm doing". 

<br />
 
I feel like this can easily cause one to be a little defensive and instead of blaming youself and trying to figure out whatever convoluted code you are reading, you just blame the code being *'bad'*. 

<br />

One thing I'm really trying to get better at is the balance between delivering code in a good amount of time and delivering something that is a respectable solution. 

<br />

I try to lean on the side of delivering a good solution as I genuinely believe in saving future me/us. But as we know nothing is black and white, and I'm sure we can all relate to having higher ups that aren't techincal and do not care about *'code quality'*. Or even worse, techincal higher ups that do not care.

<br />

Currently I do not have any method for getting this balance right. I just try to give longer estimates and be open about spending time doing small refactors. I'm not having much success with this yet as I find code I've written even just a few weeks later and hate it... Hopefully I'll see this timespan get longer and longer.

<br />

In closing, after a year I want to be a more empathetic software developer. But mostly I just want to be a good software developer... Think I'll need some patience.
