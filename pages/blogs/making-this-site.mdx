This is the 3rd time I've rebuilt this site...

<br />

I originally built this thing when I was about to finish my diploma - I
needed something to help me land a job. It was a single page site with the
typical projects and skills sutff, it looked quite nice and definitely helped me
land a job.

<br />      

I'm apparently easily bored and regularly feel the need to change things up - my
theme, font or a cool new plugin to help "productivity". I also dislike my code pretty soon after writing it, which is kinda becoming a problem... 

<br />          

I think this could be bad because instead of moving on and creating/working on projects I just spend time re-doing, already done things. On the other hand I suppose I'm learning how to do things better each time?

<br />

## The 1st iteration
The original site was a CRA (create react app) with Typescript. It was a single page scrolling site - very typical of a new developers portfolio site. I wasn't the biggest fan of this site, partly becasue the code was terrible but mainly because this was not the aesthetic I wanted. I was just ticking off the checkboxes for a portfolio site. After settling in to the industry I was keen to rebuild it.

<br /> 

## The 2nd iteration
The 2nd time I built this site was supposed to be the last... oops. I used HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP and MySql. I thought this would be more impressive than using a framework and show off some underlying knowledge. I built a dynamic client with a very basic admin/cms to add new blocks of text to the homepage and to create new blogs. I thought it was pretty great until two main issues really ruined it for me...  

<br />  

**One:** Routing to individual blog posts. This was an issue as my solution to having dynamic/unique urls for each blog was to pass the id along with some query params to the api and render it on the server. I didn't love this as I really wanted to keep the view, in the view... Also I like the domain name and once rerouted to the server, it beomes the ugly free-tier url provided by Heroku. 
<br />
**Two:** Using a free tier database/server. This was easily the most painful part of the site, the free tiers are put to sleep if there is inactivity for a short time. I knew this before building but had no idea how much it would bother me. The initial call to the server to *"wake it up"* would take ~5 seconds. This is a damn long time when talking about web page load times, especially for how little content was actually being shown. I also really didn't want to pay for one of the better tiers.

<br />  

I then decided, let's remake it! 

<br />

## The 3rd iteration (This one)
So now we are back to React (specifically Next.js) which is a little funny. I chose this for a couple reasons, at work we use Angular (I'm not the biggest fan) and I would like to try and keep my React skills somewhat up to date. I also thought that using react was probably better career wise.

<br /> 

I've tried to make this one with a more flexible approach in mind, using a component framework sure does help with that. I want this to be something I can add to for a long time without feeling the urge to rebuild. 

<br /> 

So I now have Next.js, Typescript and a couple of neat plugins to help with dates and markdown. I'm also using the Github api to pull data for the projects/readme and commit chart.

<br /> 

I think I'm optimistic about this one.
